    <h1 class="heading">Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>Ever since 2019 I had a dream which I turned into a goal. I was determined to become someone entirely diffeent than who I was at the time
        I wanted to become a more confident person, I learnt many skills, but none really made me feel confident till I descovered programming
        I thought that one day I'll be able to create a new world out of coding elements, and a new life by adding value to the tech world, and getting value
        back in monetary form. With the help of bootcamps, and online resources I taught myself the necessary programming languages to make an
        impact on the world. I was tired of working at a place where my worth is only messured by my physical ability. I had to break free, and create a new life
